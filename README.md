## I have an issue! 

Damn! I'll need to see a video of the issue to help. Let's run through some basic troubleshooting:
1. Go to "Edit Layout" and remove any "Scriptable Auto Splitter" components.
2. Make sure "Compare Against" is set to "Game Time".
3. Check that your Settings look as expected.

If your issue persists, get a recording with DebugView installed. Check out [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76xu36vsGgs).

Then raise an issue in this repository describing your problem.
